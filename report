;;; # Structural Similarity Algorithms
;;; 
;;; Compute whether 2 pages are of the same template (blog indices vs. blog posts and so on)
;; **

;; **
;;; ## Threshold based methods used:
;;; 
;;; * Tree edit distance:
;;; 
;;; Implementation of the RTDM algorithm. See: Structure-Driven Crawler Generation by Example, Vidal et. al. also a threshold based method. Fails because of false positives (we would like to avoid false positives)
;;; 
;;; * XPath-Text:
;;; 
;;; Generate XPaths using our tag+class approach to text nodes. The coordinates are (XPath, number of characters). Compute a cosine similarity and if greater than a threshold, we're good. (false positives)
;;; 
;;; * Page-Schema:
;;; Crescenzi et al approach where set interestion of paths to a-tags is used for jaccard similarity computation. Also a threshold based method (piss poor perf across the board).
;;; 
;;; * XPath-Text-Freq:
;;; Xpath-text algorithm to which we add newer coordinates which compute the number of records as well.
;;;

;;; ## Classifier based methods:
;;; 
;;; * FOCUS based approach:
;;; The focus paper uses these features:
;;; 
;;; from my understanding, there is exactly 1 kind of record picked up. Sounds v stupid but w/e
;;; 
;;;   - record-count -> number of records (how is this computed?)
;;;   - max/avg/var of width -> among all records (how is record computed again)
;;;   - max/avg/var of anchor text -> ok this is possible - don't understand what among all records means
;;;   - max/avg/var of text length -> this is also possible - don't understand what among all records means
;;;   - max/avg/var of leaf nodes -> need record
;;;   - max/avg/var of links
;;;   - has link? - 
;;;   - has timestamp?
;;;   - time order
;;;   - record tree similarity
;;;   - record text sim.
;;;   - ratio of anchor to text
;;;   - number of groups
;;; 
;;; * What we can take from FOCUS for our XPath based system
;;; 
;;;   - number of individual xpaths on p1
;;;   - number of individual xpaths on p2
;;;   - |intersection xpaths | / |union of xpaths|
;;;   - max avg len xpath on p1 and p2 are same?
;;;   - max avg len link xpath matches?
;;;   - avg link length p1
;;;   - avg link length p2
;;;   - avg text() node length p1
;;;   - avg text() node length p2
;;;   - var text() node length p1 and p2
;;;   - xpath-text sim score
;;;   - max/ avg freq based stuff
;;;   
;;;   Tasks, collect and label data (test + train),
;;;

;;; ## Results
;;; ### Threshold based methods:
;;; 
;;; * Tree Edit Distance : 0.8591549295774648 ({:fail 10, :success 61})
;;; * XPath-Text : 0.8732394366197183 ({:fail 9, :success 62}) -- WINNER
;;; * Page-schema : 0.2459016393442623 ({:fail 46, :success 15})
;;; * XPath-Text-Freq : 0.8732394366197183 ({:fail 9, :success 62})
;;; 
;;; Clearly adding frequency based info to the model is useless.
